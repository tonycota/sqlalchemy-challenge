# sqlalchemy-challenge
Submission for module 10 homework assignment

This challenge was a bit of a doozy but here is what is included within the repo. 
Two main files to analyze hawaii data that are located within the resources folder. Including two csv files and a sqlite file. 
The object was to go ahead and plan a trip to hawaii and analyze weather data within the area of Honolulu. 
Utilizing python and SQLAlchemy we were able to analyze and explore the climate database. 
Focusing on ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib, I was able to generate the data you can find in this repo. 

This was a hard one for me but I am happy with the work I have provided for this challenge!
